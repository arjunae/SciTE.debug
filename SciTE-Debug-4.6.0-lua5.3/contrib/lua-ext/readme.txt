--- Lua Extensions ---

Platform: 
	win32 / win64

Usage: 
	-	start make.all.mingw.bat
	-	Its also possible to build a specific lib by starting the make batch within its folder. 

Notes:
	If you want to build with msys, put {MsysFolder}\mingw[32||64] into your Path and 	
        Rename the clib[32||64] folders to [clib] Not perfect, but does the trick.
	If you choose to build with VC - change to the libs folder and run make.myscite.vc batches manually.
